The principles, concepts, and philosophies of development that we value most and that you need to take into account in your submission are:
[ ] Web Standards
[ ] Semantic Markup
[ ] Performance
[ ] Accessibility

### Technical Guidelines

[ ] Anchors on the page can just have “#” as their href.
[ ] Only jQuery & vanilla javascript allowed (no plugins).
[ ] No CSS libraries/frameworks may be used, however CSS (pre)processors like Sass are welcome for compiling your own css.
[ ] Rate table must be built-out and ordered correctly by consuming provided JSON file.
[ ] Page should be responsive.
[ ] Bonus-points for accessibility!
